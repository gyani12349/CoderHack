## Problem Statement

Develop a RESTful API service using Spring Boot to manage the Leaderboard for a Coding Platform while using MongoDB to persist the data.

## Problem Description

While coding platforms usually host multiple contests while maintaining numerous leaderboards, this assignment requires you to design a service for managing the leaderboard of a specific contest. Assume the platform has only one contest with a single leaderboard. The platform also gives virtual awards to the users called badges based on their score.

# Requirements

●	The API must handle CRUD operations for competing user registrations
●	Each user has the following fields: 

    ○	user ID (Unique Identifier)
    ○	username
    ○	Score (0 <= Score <= 100)
    ○	badges (Code Ninja, Code Champ, Code Master)
    
●	user registration requests must have a user ID and username
●	The score must be 0, and the badges must be empty initially after the registration
●	Updation through PUT requests is only allowed for Score
●	badges must be awarded based on the score:

    ○	1 <= Score < 30 -> Code Ninja
    ○	30 <= Score < 60 -> Code Champ
    ○	60 <= Score <= 100 -> Code Master
    
●	A user can only have a maximum of three unique badges

    ○	{Code Ninja, Code Champ, Code Master} -> Valid
    ○	{Code Ninja} -> Valid
    ○	{Code Ninja, Code Champ, Code Master, Code Ninja} -> Invalid
    
●	user retrieval must be sorted based on the score
●	Sorting should have the time complexity of O(nlogn)
●	Include basic JUnit test cases to verify the operations


## Validation and Error Handling

●	Add basic validation for all fields (Ex. Score > 0)
●	Handle common errors and return appropriate HTTP codes (Ex. 404, user not found)

## Endpoints

●	GET /users - Retrieve a list of all registered users
●	GET /users/{userId} - Retrieve the details of a specific user
●	POST /users - Register a new user to the contest
●	PUT /users/{userId} - Update the score of a specific user
●	DELETE /users/{userId} - Deregister a specific user from the contest
